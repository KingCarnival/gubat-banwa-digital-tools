    "description": "The Rajanate of Gatusan is a collection of settlements and cities all bound beneath a collectively chosen Overlord, known as the Raja. The Raja is the king, and there are many raja (a term now commonly associated with port town kings), but they are all led by the Ponong Raja, or the Highest King. The Collective of Crocodile Lords decide who becomes Ponong Raja, but lately the Collective has been gripped by the lineage of Ambasi, who traces a direct line to the legendary founder of Kangdaya, Sri Bishaya, the Tempestuous Tiger Who Roars from the White Mountain"

The Limang Timuay were each granted a shard of Apu Dayawâ€™s Violence, and therefore are bolstered with divine, righteous might. \nThe people here worship the Holy Mountain Apu, for climbing up to its peak one will arrive at the gates of heaven. Within the Holy Mountain of Apu sleeps the Original Spirit, the one that came into being, defying causation, and caused causation itself: Apu Dayaw."

    "description": "Ambitious warlords, would-be imperialists, and opportunistic merchants. The river chiefdoms of Lontok, Namayan, Malilu, and Tundun were conquered and invaded by the Empire of Issohappa, led by the Pale Kings, which introduced to them the concepts of land ownership, colonization, the printing press, and Astraiman. With the victory of Virbanwa, their destiny is now back in their hands. They are at the precipice: either they become worse than their colonizers, or use the tools forced upon them to become more than what they ever were."
